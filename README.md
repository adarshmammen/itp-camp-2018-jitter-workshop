# Live Video Processing with Max/MSP/Jitter

These are a series of Max patches intended to accompany an introductory Jitter workshop that I taught at ITP Camp 2018. The workshop syllabus and these patches are heavily based on Matt Romein's [Live Image Processing and Performance](https://github.com/mromein/lipp_itp_2018) NYU ITP course.
